Problem:
    I am having issues with the invalidate() method.  I am calling it in my onClick() method
    but it doesn't seem to be doing anything.  I have researched why this several times but
    can't seem to find anything.
Resource Used:
    I emailed Professor Vegdahl and he told me that this method has to be used on an Surface View
    object in order for it to work.
Resource Used:
    I asked my friend Andrew Ripple and he told me to use the invalidate() method on a Surface View
    object.
Solution:
    I created an instance of the FangManSurfaceView class and called the invalidate method on this
    and it worked!

    I am not sure how to play audio files when a button is pressed.
Resource Used:
    I looked this up online and found a tutorial on how to import audio files and how to add
    them into the Activity class using the Media Player class.

Problem:
    I want to add a Haunted Mansion theme background to my app but am not sure how to do so.
Resource Used:
    I looked this up online and found that you have to create a drawable folder in your res folder
    in which you store the background you would like to use.  You then have to write
    android:background="@drawable/backgroundName" into the xml for the layout.

Solution:
    I created a drawable folder, added in my picture and the line of code to the xml and was able
    to get my background to show up.

Problem:
    I want my vampire Fang Man to have a curved hairline.  I am trying to do this with a path
    and the pathName.addArc() but it is only drawing a portion of the arc.
Resource Used:
    I looked at the documentation for path and there is addArc() and also arcTo().
    https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Path.html
Solution:
    I tried using arcTo() instead of addArc() and was able to get all the arc to be drawn.
